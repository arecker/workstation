These are the ansible playbooks I use to provision the few computers I
use.  Here are some instructions, just in case I get abducted by
aliens and someone needs to take over my life for a while.

1. Install ansible.  It is probably available in your distribution.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo apt-get install ansible
   #+END_SRC

2. Type out the ansible vault password and save to somewhere.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     echo "bigGnarlyEvilmulticharacteransibleVaultpassword" > ~/.ansible-password.txt
   #+END_SRC

3. Decrypt the private gpg key in this repo.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ansible-vault decrypt --vault-password-file ~/.ansible-password.txt private.gpg.asc
   #+END_SRC

4. Import the gpg keys.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     gpg --import gpg/*.gpg.asc
   #+END_SRC

   (don't forget to later grant the key ultimate trust so gpg doesn't
   bother you about it when you try to sign or encrypt something)

5. And lastly, run ansible.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ansible-playbook --ask-sudo-pass --vault-password-file ~/.ansible-password -i hosts pi.yml
   #+END_SRC

   Once the script succeeds, you should be ready to take over my life.
